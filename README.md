Cheapo
======

This is the source code for the MacOS X port of Cheapo. Cheapo is a proxy that can be used to route QuakeWorld network traffic. Additionally, the proxy can modify the data and has features for enhancing gameplay. You can connect to cheapo as if it were a Quakeworld server, and then give it commands that forward you to a real server. The proxy can also be run on a firewall machine incapable of handling Quake traffic, so that machines inside the firewall can be used for playing.
